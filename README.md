<h1>Optimizing Session Load Times in Avid Pro Tools</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This JavaScript script runs using Soundflow and is designed for use in Avid Pro Tools. It's incredibly common for sessions in Avid Pro Tools to pause because of inconsequential events like I/O routing changes, or inactive audio plug-ins. In most cases, engineers would rather have the session load completely before assessing the events if needed.

This script looks for these pauses in session loading and closes the warning dialogues, allowing the session to continue loading. 
<p></p>
For this script we:
<ul>
  <li>Trigger our macro via several different warning windows.</li>
  <li>Choose the desired button to continue session loading.</li>

</ul>
